# TWEET50

TWEET50 is a minimalist twitter client that quickly gives you the latest 50 tweets of any user that you search for.

The site is written in HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and PHP.

TWEET50 was my final project for Harvard's CS50 class.

The core of the app is a PHP script that accesses the Twitter API to quickly grab tweets and display them.

Note: API Keys removed for privacy reasons.
